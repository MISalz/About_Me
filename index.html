<p style="background-color:gray ;color:darkblue">Is Netflix a distraction or an addition? Personally I think its both. The love of stories and adventure keep me logging in.</p>
<p style="background-color:gray ;color:purple">Was SquidGames really that great? Yes, Yes it was. It was great even if it was dubbed in English. Topped as one of the most watched tv series in all Netflix History. </p>
<p style="background-color:gray ;color:darkorange">Can you believe that some of the biggest names in movies gave up the opportunity to own Netflix? Yep, a good example is the Blockbuster story. They laughed at the Idea of a mail video rental and streaming service... whos laughin now?</p>
<p style="background-color:gray ;color:maroon">Wanna know how long ive had a netflix subscription? For over 17 years, yup since the days of getting discs in the mail for 3 day rentals. </p>
